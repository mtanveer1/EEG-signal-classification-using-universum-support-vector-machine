This is implementation of the paper: B. Richhariya, M. Tanveer, EEG signal classification using universum support vector machine, Expert Systems With Applications, Volume 106, 2018, pp. 169-182, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2018.03.053.

Description of files:

USVM.m: selecting parameters of USVM using k fold cross-validation. One can select parameters c, mu and e to be used in grid-search method.

For running the USVM algorithm, we have included the wpbc dataset. One can simply run the USVM.m file to check the obtained results on this sample dataset. To run experiments on more datasets, simply add datasets in the folder and run USVM.m file.
